# taste_of_decor
Introducing 'Taste of Decor' - a groundbreaking online platform I developed for my final year diploma project. It's a one-stop hub connecting customers, retailers, and design experts worldwide. With proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, I created this platform to facilitate international shopping, empower emerging designers, and offer expert guidance. 'Taste of Decor' also supports small businesses, providing them a platform to sell their products. It's a game-changer, especially during the pandemic, offering free consultations and invaluable design tips. I'm excited about the potential impact of this project in the field of web development.
